Before we begin, I'd like to briefly review the agenda for today's discussion. We'll be covering the importance of CSR, recent trends, and how our company can improve its practices. 00:00:20 --> 00:01:00 Carlos: I'd like to add that we also have a special guest, John from the sustainability department, who will share some insights on our current initiatives. 00:01:00 --> 00:02:00 John: Hi everyone, thanks for having me. I'll be discussing our current efforts in reducing carbon emissions and increasing community engagement. 00:02:00 --> 00:04:00 Hiroshi: I'd like to ask, how do we measure the success of our CSR initiatives? Are we using any specific metrics or benchmarks? 00:04:00 --> 00:05:00 Fatima: Great question, Hiroshi. That's something we'll be discussing later in the meeting. Alexei, can you walk us through some of the recent trends in CSR? 00:05:00 --> 00:08:00 Alexei: Certainly. One trend we're seeing is the increased focus on transparency and accountability. Companies are being held to higher standards by consumers and stakeholders. 00:08:00 --> 00:10:00 Carlos: That's interesting. How do you think this will impact our company's reputation and bottom line? 00:10:00 --> 00:12:00 John: Well, research has shown that companies with strong CSR practices tend to outperform those without. It's not just about doing good, but also about doing well. 00:12:00 --> 00:15:00 Hiroshi: I'd like to add that our Asian markets are particularly sensitive to CSR issues. We need to ensure we're meeting local expectations and regulations. 00:15:00 --> 00:18:00 Fatima: Thank you, Hiroshi. That's an important point. Alexei, can you summarize some of the key takeaways from our discussion so far? 00:18:00 --> 00:20:00 Alexei: Sure. We've covered the importance of CSR, recent trends, and some of the benefits of strong CSR practices. 00:20:00 --> 00:25:00 Carlos: I'd like to propose that we establish a CSR working group to further develop our initiatives and track progress. 00:25:00 --> 00:28:00 John: I agree. It would be beneficial to have a dedicated team focused on CSR issues. 00:28:00 --> 00:30:00 Hiroshi: I'd like to volunteer to join the working group. I think it's essential we have representation from various departments. 00:30:00 --> 00:35:00 Fatima: Great, let's make that happen. We'll schedule a follow-up meeting to discuss the working group's objectives and timeline. 00:35:00 --> 00:40:00 Alexei: Before we adjourn, are there any final questions or comments? 00:40:00 --> 00:45:00 Carlos: Just one question, what's the target timeline for implementing our new CSR initiatives? 00:45:00 --> 00:50:00 Fatima: We're aiming to have a comprehensive plan in place within the next quarter. 00:50:00 --> 00:55:00 John: I think that's ambitious, but achievable. We'll need to work closely together to make it happen. 00:55:00 --> 00:58:00 Fatima: Thank you all for your participation and input today. Let's keep the momentum going and make a positive impact on our communities and the environment.",
